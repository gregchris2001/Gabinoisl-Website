      "description": "This minimalist two-layered LED pendant lamp is a sleek and contemporary lighting fixture designed with simplicity and functionality in mind. Within the outer frame, the inner layer holds the LED light source. The inner layer is designed to be unobtrusive, with a subtle profile that doesn't detract from the lamp's overall simplicity. The LED light source is energy-efficient, providing a soft and warm illumination that enhances the ambient lighting in any space. The pendant lamp is typically suspended from a thin and discreet cable, adding to the illusion of weightlessness and contributing to the overall minimalist effect.",
